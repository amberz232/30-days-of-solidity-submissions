# Day 1 of 30

Concepts

- Basic Solidity syntax
- Variables (uint)
- Increment/Decrement functions

Progression

- Foundational syntax and basic contract structure.

Example Application

Let's build a simple counter! Imagine a digital clicker. You'll create a 'function' named `click()`. Each time someone calls this function, a number stored in the contract (a 'variable') will increase by one. You'll learn how to declare a variable to hold a number (an `uint`) and create functions to change it (increment/decrement). This is the very first step in making interactive smart contracts, showing how to store and modify data.
