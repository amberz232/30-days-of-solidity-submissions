# **SUBMISSION GUIDELINES**

Follow these steps to submit your code for any day of the 30 Days of Solidity challenge:

---

**1. Fork this repository**

Click the “Fork” button on the top right of this page to create your own copy of the repo.

**2. Clone your fork**

If you want to work locally, use:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/30-days-of-solidity-submissions.git`

**3. Inside `submissions/`, create a folder with your GitHub username**

This helps us keep track of everyone's submissions.

Example:

```
submissions/
    └── dev-sethu/
```

**4. Add your code**

Drop your `.sol` file (or multiple files if needed) into your folder.
Example:

```
submissions/
    └── dev-sethu/
        └── day1-contract.sol
        └── day2-contract.sol

```

**5. Commit and push your changes**

```bash

git add .
git commit -m "Day04 - Submission by @your-github-username"
git push origin main

```

**6. Open a Pull Request**

Go to your fork on GitHub and open a PR to this main repo.

Use this title format:

`Day04 - Submission by @your-github-username`
